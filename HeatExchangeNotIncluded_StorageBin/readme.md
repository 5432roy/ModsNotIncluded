## Description

The **Insulate Storage Bin** mod introduces a new building to the game: the *Insulate Storage Bin*. 
This building is designed to prevent stored items from exchanging heat and emitting heat into the environment. 
By isolating the thermal properties of stored items, the mod helps to improve thermal efficiency and reduce unnecessary heat load during late-game scenarios.
I set the building material to Insulite because it matches both the late game and the insulation concept for this building. 
Might add a menu option for the mod to let uses choose if they want this kind of balance setting.

## Support

Both *DLC* and *VANILLA*.

Lastest Game Patch Tested: [Game Hotfix] - 652372
