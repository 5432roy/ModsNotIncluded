**Mods Not Included** is a collection of mods developed by me for *Oxygen Not Included*. These mods are designed to enhance and optimize your gaming experience by introducing innovative features and performance improvements that extend the base game.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains several mods, including:

- **Insulate Storage Bin:**  
  A standout mod that prevents stored items from exchanging heat and emitting gas into the environment. This mod improves game performance—especially in late-game scenarios with countless objects—and offers customizable settings such as adjustable storage capacity and balanced construction costs.
- **No More Supply Errands**
  A mod that removes all errands from the game to fix the bad job scheduling design in the game. Improves the errands completion efficiency by reducing the duplicants travel time 
- *(Additional mod projects can be listed here as they become available.)*

## Featured Mod: Insulate Storage Bin

The **Insulate Storage Bin** mod isolates the thermal properties of stored materials, resulting in:

- **Enhanced Performance:**  
  Reduces unnecessary computation by preventing heat transfer and gas emissions.
  
- **Customizable Storage:**  
  Default capacity is set to 200t, with the option to adjust between 1t and 1000t.
  
- **Balanced Construction Costs:**  
  Constructed with 400kg of refined metal and 200kg of Insulite. (The Insulite requirement can be toggled in the in-game settings menu.)

> **Important:** Disabling this mod will remove all items stored in the insulated storage bins. Always ensure that bins are emptied before disabling the mod. If the mod is accidentally disabled, reloading an earlier saved game (with the mod re-enabled) should restore your items.
